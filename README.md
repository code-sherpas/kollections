# Kollections

This project is led by Code Sherpas ([www.code-sherpas.rocks](https://www.code-sherpas.rocks/), [Slack](https://code-sherpas.slack.com/), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/code-sherpas))

Kollections is a [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) open source library to fill the gap that currently exists in the [Kotlin Standard Library](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/) regarding [data structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure).

The final objective is to achieve a mature enough state in order to make Kotlin maintainers consider to include this project in the Kotlin Standard Library.
